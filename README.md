My homeworks from the course "Machine learning 1" in NRU HSE


## hw2
In this homework, I was working with taxi ride data. I did EDA, did feature engineering, and trained linear models to predict the length of a trip. Due to the too large outputs cells, I had to download the version without outputs (hw2_Gavrin_Gleb_eda_linreg_feature_engineering_cleaned)

## hw3
In this homework, I worked with classification problems using SVM and Logistic Regression. I implemented probability calibration, explored different methods for encoding categorical variables (including One-Hot Encoding and Mean-Target Encoding), performed feature selection using various techniques (embedded methods, filter methods, and wrapper methods), and evaluated the economic impact of the model by optimizing for profit. Due to the large output cells, I had to download the version without outputs (linclass_hw_cleaned).
