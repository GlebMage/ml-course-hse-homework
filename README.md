My homework from the course "Machine learning 1" in NRU HSE


## hw2
In this homework, I was working with taxi ride data. I did EDA, did feature engineering, and trained linear models to predict the length of a trip. Due to the too large outputs cells, I had to download the version without outputs (hw2_Gavrin_Gleb_eda_linreg_feature_engineering_cleaned)

## hw3
In this homework, I worked with classification problems using SVM and Logistic Regression. I implemented probability calibration, explored different methods for encoding categorical variables (including One-Hot Encoding and Mean-Target Encoding), performed feature selection using various techniques (embedded methods, filter methods, and wrapper methods), and evaluated the economic impact of the model by optimizing for profit. Due to the large output cells, I had to download the version without outputs (linclass_hw_cleaned).


## hw4
In this homework, I worked with multiclass classification problems using various approaches. I compared One-vs-Rest (OvR) and One-vs-One (OvO) strategies with Logistic Regression, implemented hyperparameter tuning using Optuna, and built a custom Softmax Regression model from scratch. I also analyzed feature importance using Random Forest and permutation importance, and evaluated model performance using macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-score. The dataset used was related to student retention in higher education, and despite extensive tuning, the models showed limited performance due to weak predictive features.
